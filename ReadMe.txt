## Code Samples



**Math.swift:**

This class makes complex mathematical computations to determine things such as binomial probability.  
It can also a simulation for an online card game to determine the probability of certain scenarios occuring.



**ObjC / MainMenuScene.m**

This class used SpriteKit to programmatically create the main menu screen.  
This screen had multiple animations, and including StoreKit and Social functionality.



**ObjC / TDDataController.m:**

This class was responsible for fetching, parsing, and returning data from my webservice.  
Normally, I'd break this up into multiple components, but this was for a personal project and I wasn't as concerned about cleanliness.



**VRUnityCSharp / InstructionManager.cs, MenuManager.cs:**

These are couple small classes in C# from my VR Project, ClutchVR.  
These classes are responsible for managing the menu, and managing the set of instructions in the driving course.
